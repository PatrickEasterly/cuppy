-- homepage description
-- homepage gets only 3 links
-- if you go somewhere when you're logged out, go home
-- comments, docs, README
-- profile cups just gives you yours
<!-- -- yourAPIkey is just text like this: -->
<!-- 'Your api key: (key)' -->
-- if logged in, login goes to profile
-- We need links to our update pages, preferably on the userprofile page
-- The links to which ones to update can probably be loop generated
