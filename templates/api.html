    <h2>How to use Cuppy coffee API</h2>

    <br><br>Cuppy coffee API is built on a database of Roasted Coffee, Coffee Shops, Coffee Roasters, Green Coffee, and User reviews of individual cups of coffee from these producers from coffee seed, to coffee cup.
    
    <br><br>With this API, users will be able to access some in depth information about producers on every step of the supply chain, in an easily usable format.
    
    <br><br>To start using Cuppy, all users must sign up, using the links above, to aquire an API Key. Currently, each API key is limited to 360 API calls an hour.
    
    <br><br>Every /API/ URL will return a JSON array or object, but invalid keys, invalid urls, or keys over the call limit will return {error :"error message"}
    
    <br><br>Any API call for a nonexistient ID will return {}
    
    <br><br>All API calls should start with /API/<b>APIKey</b>
