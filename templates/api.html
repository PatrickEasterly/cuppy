    <h1>How to use Cuppy coffee API</h1>

    <p>Cuppy coffee API is built on a database of Roasted Coffee, Coffee Shops, Coffee Roasters, Green Coffee, and User reviews of individual cups of coffee from these producers from coffee seed, to coffee cup.</p>
    
    <p>With this API, users will be able to access some in depth information about producers on every step of the supply chain, in an easily usable format.</p>
    
    <p>To start using Cuppy, all users must sign up, using the links above, to aquire an API Key. Currently, each API key is limited to 360 API calls an hour.</p>
    
    <p>Every /API/ URL will return a JSON array or object, but invalid keys, invalid urls, or keys over the call limit will return {error :"error message"}</p>
    
    <p>Any API call for a nonexistient ID will return {}</p>
    
    <p>All API calls should start with /API/<b>APIKey</b></p>
